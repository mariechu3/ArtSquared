# Art^2
Website for CS147 project: Art ^2

> "Learn art and build your community one pixel at a time"

# Usage

## website
to spin up the website locally run, navigate to `artSquared/website` and run:
`python -m http.server 9000` 

open your brower to view the site at `http://localhost:9000/`


## app
to spin up the app locally download Expo Go from the app store, navigate to `artSquared/app` and run:
`npm i` (this installs dependencies for the project that are specified in the package json)
`npm start` (this starts your project)

scan the QR to open the app on Expo

*npm stands for node package manager and is super useful to make sure you have the right versions of all the dependencies (kinda like requirements.txt in python)

A simple single pager built around an angular motif (powered by SVG awesomeness).
Should work great for a landing page. Also includes default styling for a bunch of
standard page elements (uncomment the huge block of commented-out HTML to see it).
